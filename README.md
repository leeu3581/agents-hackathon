# Origins

## Project Overview

Origins is an AI-powered intelligence agent designed to address the growing challenge of information reliability in the digital age. As the internet becomes increasingly saturated with AI-generated content and overwhelming amounts of data, distinguishing credible sources from misleading information has become a critical challenge.

Our solution integrates advanced search capabilities with a sophisticated critique agent that systematically evaluates and scores sources based on multiple reliability metrics. Origins aims to empower users with real-time access to verified references, facilitating informed decision-making and rebuilding trust in online information consumption.

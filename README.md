# Origins

## Project Overview

Origins is an AI-powered agent designed to tackle the challenge of unreliable information online. With the proliferation of AI-generated content and the overwhelming volume of data, distinguishing between credible and misleading sources has become increasingly difficult. Origins addresses this by integrating advanced search capabilities with a critique agent that evaluates and scores sources for reliability. It aims to provide users with accurate references in real-time, promoting informed decision-making and trust in online information.
